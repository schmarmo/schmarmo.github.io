    <p>Bruno Schulz was a remarkable Polish-Jewish writer and artist, best known for his evocative and surreal prose
      that intertwines the extraordinary with the mundane, often drawing on his own childhood experiences in the small
      town of Drohobych.</p>

        <p>Born in <span style="color: #7B0000;">1892</span> Schulz's literary career was marked by his two major works,
          <span style="color: #7B0000;">"The Street of Crocodiles"</span> and <span style="color: #7B0000;">"Sanatorium
            Under the Sign of the Hourglass,"</span> both of which highlight his unique style characterised by rich
          imagery and intricate metaphors. His writings reflect a deep sense of <span
            style="color: #7B0000;">nostalgia</span> and an uncanny ability to capture the <span
            style="color: #7B0000;">complexities of human emotion and memory.</span>
        </p>

        <p> In addition to his literary contributions, Schulz was a talented visual artist, <span
            style="color: #7B0000;">illustrating his own works</span> and creating remarkable paintings that
          complemented
          his narratives. Tragically, his life was cut short during the <span style="color: #7B0000;">Holocaust</span>,
          but his legacy endures, influencing countless writers and artists with his imaginative storytelling and
          profound
          exploration of identity and memory.</p>

          <h2>Chapter 1: August</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In July my father went to take the waters and left me, with my mother and elder brother, a prey to the
          blinding white heat of the summer days. Dizzy with light, we dipped into that enormous book of holidays, its
          pages blazing with sunshine and scented with the sweet melting pulp of golden pears.

          On those luminous mornings Adela returned from the market, like Pomona emerging from the flames of day,
          spilling from her basket the colourful beauty of the sun — the shiny pink cherries full of juice under their
          transparent skins, the mysterious black morellos that smelled so much better than they tasted; apricots in
          whose golden pulp lay the core of long afternoons. And next to that pure poetry of fruit, she unloaded sides
          of meat with their keyboard of ribs swollen with energy and strength, and seaweeds of vegetables like dead
          octopuses and squids — the raw material of meals with a yet undefined taste, the vegetative and terrestrial
          ingredients of dinner, exuding a wild and rustic smell.

          The dark second-floor apartment of the house in Market Square was shot through each day by the naked heat of
          summer: the silence of the shimmering streaks of air, the squares of brightness dreaming their intense
          dreams on the floor; the sound of a barrel organ rising from the deepest golden vein of day; two or three
          bars of a chorus, played on a distant piano over and over again, melting in the sun on the white pavement,
          lost in the fire of high noon.

          After tidying up, Adela would plunge the rooms into semi-darkness by drawing down the linen blinds. All
          colours immediately fell an octave lower, the room filled with shadows, as if it had sunk to the bottom of
          the sea and the light was reflected in mirrors of green water — and the heat of the day began to breathe on
          the blinds as they stirred slightly in their daydreams.

      <div class="body__mid">
        <p>On Saturday afternoons I used to go for a walk with my mother. From the dusk of the hallway, we stepped at
          once into the brightness of the day. The passers-by, bathed in melting gold, had their eyes half closed
          against the glare, as if they were drenched with honey. Upper lips were drawn back, exposing the teeth.
          Everyone in this golden day wore that grimace of heat — as if the sun had forced his worshippers to wear
          identical masks of gold. The old and the young, women and children, greeted each other with these masks,
          painted on their faces with thick gold paint; they smiled at each other’s pagan faces — the barbaric smiles of
          Bacchus.

          Market Square was empty and white-hot, swept by hot winds like a biblical desert. The thorny acacias, growing
          in this emptiness, looked with their bright leaves like the trees on old tapestries. Although there was no
          breath of wind, they rustled their foliage in a theatrical gesture, as if wanting to display the elegance of
          the silver lining of their leaves that resembled the fox-fur lining of a nobleman’s coat. The old houses, worn
          smooth by the winds of innumerable days, played tricks with the reflections of the atmosphere, with echoes and
          memories of colours scattered in the depth of the cloudless sky. It seemed as if whole generations of summer
          days, like patient stonemasons cleaning the mildewed plaster from old facades, had removed the deceptive
          varnish revealing more and more clearly the true face of the houses, the features that fate had given them and
          life had shaped for them from the inside. Now the windows, blinded by the glare of the empty square, had
          fallen asleep; the balconies declared their emptiness to heaven; the open doorways smelt of coolness and wine.

          A bunch of ragamuffins, sheltering in a corner of the square from the flaming broom of the heat, beleaguered a
          piece of wall, throwing buttons and coins at it over and over again, as if wishing to read in the horoscope of
          those metal discs the real secret written in the hieroglyphics of cracks and scratched lines. Apart from them,
          the square was deserted. One expected that, any minute, the Samaritan’s donkey, led by the bridle, would stop
          in front of the wine merchant’s vaulted doorway and that two servants would carefully ease a sick man from the
          red-hot saddle and carry him slowly up the cool stairs to the floor above, already redolent of the Sabbath.
